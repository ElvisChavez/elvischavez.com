					<p>My name is Elvis Chavez and I'm 25 years old born and living in North Texas. My career is currently focused in IT Support, but I enjoy taking on additional projects and hobbies. I've created this site to showcase my resume as well as my HTML and CSS skills. I'll be updating it regularly and adding more features and additional projects I've taken part in.
